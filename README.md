- On older Windows builds you may need to run the below command before,  
`[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`  
- The Powershell method does not work on Windows 7. Use the Method 2 - Traditional instead.  
- The URL get.activated.win may be blocked by some DNS services because it is a new domain.

### Method 2 - Traditional (Windows 7 and later)

1.   Download the file
2.   Right-click on the downloaded zip file and extract
3.   In the extracted folder, find the folder named `All-In-One-Version`
4.   Run the file named `MAS_AIO.cmd`
5.   You will see the activation options, follow the on-screen instructions.
6.   That's all.
